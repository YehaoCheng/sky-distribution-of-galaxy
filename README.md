The first folders are named in pixel size. We chose the proper pixel size according to the FoV of telescope.

MASS/SFR_D30_1.83deg_gal.txt
D30: luminosity distance: 30Mpc;
1.83deg: pixel size;
gal: galactic coordinates (no gal means equatorial coordinates)

In the text file, there are four column: 
pix_num : sequence number of pixel,different pixel size (resolution) has different total pixel.
ra/l: right ascension/galactic longitude.
dec/b: declination/galactic latitude.
mass/SFR: total mass/SFR within this pixel (In logarithmic form).
