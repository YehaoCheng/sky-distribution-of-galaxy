The first folders are named in angular resolutions of grids. We could chose the proper angular resolution according to the FoV of telescope.
Both the Mass and SFR folders contain data based on equatorial coordinate. 

MASS/SFR_D30_1.83deg.txt

D30: luminosity distance: 30Mpc.
1.83deg: angular resolution of grid.

In the text file, there are four columns: 

1.grid_num : sequence number of gird, different angular resolution has different total number pixel.

2.ra: right ascension of central coordinate of grid.

3.dec: declination of central coodinate of grid.

4.Mass/SFR: total mass/SFR within this grid (logarithmic form).
